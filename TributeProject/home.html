        <h2 id="opinion-title">Personal Opinion</h2>
        <p id="opinion-info">
            I learned about Dr. Norman Borlaugh after reading his book [2] as recommended in a  <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Man-Who-Fed-the-World" target="_blank">blog post on Gates Notes talking about the history of crop growth in developing nations.</a> What I found truly amazing is the similarity of his early career and cross-roads faced to what the average person experiences. He did not come from a priveleged position. When confronted with diverging paths that we see in our careers, he chose the humanitarian route. His decision to forego a significant salary increase during his wife's pregnancy to travel abroad in an effort to improve agriculture worldwide deserves an award on its own. To me that is a  challenging decision and truly underscores his passion for making the world a better place. Even the story behind him learning about his nobel prize award is humbling (talked about in his biography [2]). He was working in the fields.
